🔭 I’m currently working on [FT_Transcendence](https://github.com/frdescam/transcendence/tree/badam)

🌱 I’m currently learning mostly C/C++ and Vue.JS at [42 Paris](https://42.fr/)

⚡ Fun fact: I already acquired strong web skills before joining 42 Paris as I made [Libre LGBT](https://www.libre-lgbt.fr/) 🏳️‍🌈 since ~2014
